# MAZATSKevin_6_26022021

MAZATSKevin_6_26022021 is my take on the sixth project from OpenClassroom Frontend Dev training. It focuses on accessibility, and the end goal is to create a photographer platform meeting WCAG requirements from scratch with fetched content. It's amy first attempt at building a SPA in vanila JS.

## Usage
